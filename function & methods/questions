🔹 1. Function

A function is a block of code that:

Performs a specific task.

Can take input (parameters) and return output.

Can be reused multiple times.

💡 In Java, all functions must belong to a class. So technically, Java doesn't have standalone functions like some other languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Instead, they are called methods.

🔹 2. Method

A method is basically a function that belongs to a class.

In Java:

Every function is a method.

Methods are defined inside classes.

✅ Example: Java Method
public class Example {

    // This is a method
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = add(5, 3); // calling the method
        System.out.println("Sum is: " + result);
    }
}

🔍 Breakdown:

add(int a, int b) is a method.

It takes two integers and returns their sum.

It’s called from main().

✅ Difference Between Function and Method (Summary)
Feature	Function (general concept)	Method (Java-specific)
Belongs to	May or may not belong to a class	Always belongs to a class
Standalone	Can be standalone	Cannot be standalone in Java
Invocation	Called directly	Called via object or class (if static)
Java	Not technically a term in Java	Preferred term in Java
🔹 Types of Methods in Java:

Static Method

Belongs to the class, not objects.

Can be called without creating an object.

public static void greet() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
}


Instance Method

Belongs to an object of the class.

You need to create an object to call it.

public void sayHi() {
    System.out.println("Hi!");
}

🧠 Final Tip:

In Java, always define your logic inside methods. Think of "method" as Java’s version of a function.
